Sidechain is what we used to call the greased network.

Sidechain is a cryptographically pegged network that operates as a semi-secure sidechain for a traditionally PoW blockchain.

Scaling is achieved by:

- Having the pegged network. The pegged network has fast transaction characteristics because it can run without consensus as a trusted sidechain.
- Having batch micronote settlement - these pre-move funds into them so that you can quickly settle with a mediator that all decentralized parties can trust. Funds moved in will be held in micronoteBatch for 8 hours, but give the decentralized parties trust that funds have been locked up and can pay for the data.
