## Purchase Bonds on Mainchain
These will likely be implemented in 4.x. Bonds can be purchased on the mainchain anytime the price dips below 1 fiat. They are guaranteed payout “first” as new Argons are added to circulation. In the Argon blockchain, the 20% burn of data queries allows bond purchasers to calculate when they will be paid back. It is a function of volume being burnt out of total circulation vs the current price dip.
